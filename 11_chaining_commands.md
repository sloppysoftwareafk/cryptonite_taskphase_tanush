# Chaining Commands

## Chaining with semi-colons

You can chain commands using the semi-colon `;`.
<br>
Basically, when you hit Enter, your shell executes your typed command and, 
after that command terminates, give you the prompt to input another command. 
The semicolon is analogous, 
just without the prompt and with you entering both commands before anything is executed.

```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wI9_HmxAMQKiz0WXs9WP1HverC0.dVTN4QDL0ITN0czW}
```
