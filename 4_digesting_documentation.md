# Digesting Documentations

## Learning from Documentation

Things we learnt : The correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, in the proper specification of arguments to them.
<br>
Recall the `-a` of `ls`; `-a` in the hidden files challenge of the Basic Commands module: that `-a` was an argument that told `ls` to list out hidden files as well as non-hidden files.
Because we wanted to list out hidden files, invoking ls with the `-a` argument was the correct way to use it in our scenario.

```
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8GXoqfnnyQCBhcoe4Otsp00KVDn.dRjM5QDL0ITN0czW}
```

In this challenge, we need to `/challenge/challenge` with the argument `--giveflag` to retrieve the flag.
