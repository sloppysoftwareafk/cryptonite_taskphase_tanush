# Practicing Piping

## Redirecting output

You can use the `>` character to redirect stdout to files.

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{UMxqymeNOgrRMP4U0HCwnK7RTJd.dRjN1QDL0ITN0czW}
```

In this challenge, we need to redirect `PWN` to the file `COLLEGE` to retrieve the flag.
